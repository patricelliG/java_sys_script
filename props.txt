"HIGH": Applications that are signed with a valid or expired certificate and include the Permissions attribute in the manifest for the main JAR file are allowed to run with security prompts. Applications are also allowed to run with security prompts when the revocation status of the certificate cannot be checked. All other applications are blocked. "VERY_HIGH": Applications that are signed with a valid certificate and include the Permissions attribute in the manifest for the main JAR file are allowed to run with security prompts. All other applications are blocked.
deployment.webjava.enabled @ Boolean @ true @ Must be "true" to run applets or Java Web Start applications.
deployment.insecure.jres @ String @ "PROMPT" @ "NEVER": Untrusted content will always run with the default JRE. "PROMPT": Prompt user before using insecure JRE versions; users will see the new warning dialogs
deployment.expiration.check.enabled @ Boolean @ true @ Must be "true" to prompt users to update the JRE when an out-of-date JRE is found on their system. Set to "false" to suppress the prompt.
deployment.security.askgrantdialog.show @ Boolean @ true @ Must be "true" if the user is allowed to grant permissions at all.

deployment.security.trusted.policy @ String @ "" @ Policy file contains the ceiling policy of permissions granted to trusted applications and applets. By default this is all permissions, but by using this configuration setting, a user or enterprise can configure a lesser set of permissions.
deployment.security.mixcode @ String @ ENABLE @ "ENABLE" enables the software to test for mixing trusted and untrusted code and, when potentially unsafe components are detected, raises a warning dialog. "HIDE_RUN" suppresses the warning dialog and, if potentially unsafe components are detected, behaves as if the user had clicked Run in the warning dialog - the applet or application continues running with some added protections. "HIDE_CANCEL" suppresses the warning dialog and behaves as if the user had clicked Cancel in the warning dialog - potentially unsafe components are blocked from running and the program may terminate. "DISABLE" (not recommended) disables the software from checking for mixing trusted and untrusted code, leaving the user to run potentially unsafe code with no warning and without the additional protections.
deployment.security.sandbox.awtwarningwindow @ Boolean @ true @ "true" if the sandbox has awtShowWindowWithoutWarning.

deployment.security.sandbox.casigned @ String @ PROMPT @ "PROMPT": Prompt user to allow the app to run and provide information on the certificate used to sign the app. The user can choose to turn off future prompting for this application. "NEVER": Block any content from running unless it asks for and is granted all permissions.
deployment.security.blacklist.check @ Boolean @ true @ Support for blacklisting signed JAR files that contain serious security vulnerabilities. deployment.security.blacklist.check is used to toggle this behaviour. For more information visit Blacklist Feature.
deployment.security.revocation.check @ String @ ALL_CERTIFICATES @ "PUBLISHER_ONLY" checks only the certificate that the publisher used to sign the application. "ALL_CERTIFICATES" checks all certificates in the certificate chain. "NO_CHECK" (not recommended) suppresses the check for certificates that have been revoked.

deployment.security.validation.timeout @ int @ 15 @ Maximum time, in seconds, that the system attempts to connect to the server for revocation checks before timing out. If the property is not set, or the value is negative, the default of 15 seconds is used. To never time out, set the property to 0.
deployment.security.authenticator @ Boolean @ true @ Normally Plug-in and Web Start install an Authenticator to handle communication with Authenticating web pages or Authenticating proxies. This is the default behavior (true). This option can be used to turn the normal behavior off if, for example, an application communicates itself with an authenticating web page and needs to install it's own Authenticator.
